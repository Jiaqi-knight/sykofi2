..What is Palabos CG?

CG stands for Computer Graphics (to o much
for this little work but anyway).

First, a little  script  taking  a  binary 
results of Palabos directory  and produces 
a raytraced  .mp4 animation using POV-Ray.

Second, an  example  splash of liquid drop 
figures and animation done  using  Palabos 
CG. Please  note  the  splashing  drop  is 
a simple  modification  of  the  Palabos's 
free surface example.

..The splash of liquid drop?

Dating back to 2001 I made myself busy for 
years playing   with  Harlow's  &  Welch's  
Marker  and   Cell   algorithm to simulate 
the  free  surface  flows. I was trying to 
reproduce     their two-dimensional splash 
effects (I actually did  my  MSc on it). I 
still like to see this phenomena in motion 
and.. thats it.
